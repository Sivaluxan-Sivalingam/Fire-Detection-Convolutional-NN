In our paper we showed results on two datasets:
- A self created diverse dataset with images randomly sampled from our self-shot fire and non-fire
videos.
- Foggia's dataset (used for testing), which is available here (https://mivia.unisa.it/datasets/video-analysis-datasets/fire-detection-dataset/).

It needs to be mentioned that the data used for training is only our custom created dataset, and not Foggia's full dataset. Testing was performed on previously held-out samples from our dataset as well as on Foggia's dataset.
